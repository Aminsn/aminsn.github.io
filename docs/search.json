My passion for data transcends the entire pipeline - I find thrill in every step, from the nitty-gritty of data cleaning (surprising, isn’t it?) to the exhilarating task of transforming raw data into actionable insights. With each dataset, I aim to uncover hidden patterns, unlock value, and craft a compelling data-driven story. Welcome to my world, where data isn’t just numbers, but a catalyst for change.\n\n\n Coding – Data Science – Machine Learning – Bayesian Statistical modelling – Sports"
